## Overview

I just finished a course on CSS, and now I'm in the stage where I need to get more experience actually building things to improve.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I felt alot more comfortable with this problem. I wasn't sure if we needed to make this one responsive, so I didn't for this one. But, I think I will in the future for existing problems, because I did not enjoy how the card did not shrink to fit the viewport.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning more about Flexbox & Grid. I also would like to learn the best practices for structuring CSS.
Once I'm comfortable, I'll move on to backend development, getting better at React, and learning some DevOps.
